## Note
本檔案討論了“基礎設施作為城市化”的概念，以及設計在尋找基礎設施挑戰新解決方案方面的作用。 它探討了景觀城市化如何演變為景觀基礎設施，並重點介紹了一些文章、採訪和作品，這些文章、採訪和作品討論了設計投資在公共領域的重要性、大型基礎設施專案的決策過程以及基礎設施景觀移動在構建和維持健康城市方面的潛力。
1. 如何利用基礎設施來創造一個更可持續的城市環境？
2. 設計師在開發新的基礎設施解決方案方面可以發揮什麼作用？
3. 基礎設施專案如何賦予公民和決策者權力？

## Highlights
Infrastructure is also a civic project, and as such just as worthy of design consideration as the vernacular urban fabric and territory to which it gives structure.

More importantly for us, however, is the ability of infrastructure to offer a framework for asking larger questions about competing visions of urban structure and performance: about the relationship of a designed intervention to its surrounding biophysical flows; about the connection between a system, its context and constituents; about the role of social and economic forces in shaping urban life.
> 問：基礎設施在城市結構和效能方面提供了什麼？
> 答：基礎設施提供了一個框架，用於就城市結構和績效的競爭願景提出更大的問題，例如設計干預與其周圍的生物物理流動之間的關係，系統、其背景和成分之間的聯絡，以及社會和經濟力量在塑造城市生活中的作用。

The [Landscape Infrastructure Symposium](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/events/landscape-infrastructure.html) at the Harvard GSD in 2012, invited a group of architects, landscape architects, historians, engineers, and ecologists to explore ”the future of infrastructure and urbanization beyond the dogma of civil engineering and transportation planning” and “to propose responsive strategies that address the predominant challenges facing urban economies today”

Along the eastern seaboard, serious debates between proponents and opponents of “hard” engineered defenses are ongoing, representing a kind of proxy war between traditional engineering approaches and an emerging alliance of advocates for more flexible and responsive, though mostly still untested, “soft” systems.
